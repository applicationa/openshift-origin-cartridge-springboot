openshift-origin-cartridge-nginx
================================

An nginx cartridge for OpenShift. This is based on the Software Collections distribution of Nginx, and as such is suited to Enterprise deployments where supported packages are a concern.

Before deploying the cartridge, ensure you have enabled the Software Collections channel, and install Nginx onto each gear from that channel.
